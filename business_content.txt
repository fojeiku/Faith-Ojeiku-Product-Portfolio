Introduction Statement
A great product doesn’t just deliver value, it creates growth across the ecosystem.
As CDL Checkout gained traction, my focus shifted from usability to scalability, ensuring our BNPL model drove tangible results for both merchants and consumers. We built an ecosystem-driven model where merchants benefited from higher sales conversions and GMV growth, while consumers accessed flexible credit at the lowest, most transparent rates in the market.
By Year 2, CDL Checkout had achieved national scale across major retail hubs, expanded its merchant network to over 1,000 active partners, and drove measurable sales uplift for key partners like SLOT and OPPO, Nigeria’s largest retail electronics brands. Every decision from pricing to partnerships was designed to balance user accessibility, merchant profitability, and business sustainability.
